# Data Science Portfolio

The repository contains a portfolio of data science projects I completed for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes. They are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, Python codes, and R markdown files.
For a more visually pleasing experience for browsing the portfolio, check out[abdo.tech](https://abdo.tech)
**The R portfolio is coming soon!**
*Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under the [Dataset] (https://github.com/abdo-projects/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Dataset) directory) is only for demonstration purposes. The datasets are Free Public datasets available in Kaggle*
## Contents
### - Machine Learning (Supervised learning)
#### - k-nearest neighbors (KNN)
-	[Predicting Adult Income] (https://github.com/abdo-projects/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/K_Nearest_Neighbors/knn_adult_income.ipynb): A model to precisely predict individualsâ€™ income using Adult data Set collected from the UCI machine learning repository. Our goal with this implementation is to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.
